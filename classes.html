      <p>
        Classes are held at the International District Chinatown Community
        Center in Seattle, Washington. <br />
        We teach a variety of classic kung-fu fighting techniques through the
        neoclassical style of Baat Ying Batt Faat (Eight Animals and Eight
        Methods). <br />
        By blending traditional kicking, striking, and grappling methods with
        modern fighting theories, our Si-Jo (founder) Allen Chinn <br />
        has created a system of Chinese Martial arts that respects tradition
        while staying relevant for today's practitioner.

      TRAINING
    </h2>
    <p>
      We use the sun-moon salute and standard stretches to open class. Our warm-up routine is a sequence of kicking, punching, and stance training. <br> The training portion varies according to the season, level of experience, and interests of the students. Training can include traditional forms, <br> weapons instruction, fighting drills, conditioning, or sparring*.
