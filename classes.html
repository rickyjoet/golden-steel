        Classes are held at the International District Chinatown Community
        Center in Seattle, Washington. <br />
        We teach a variety of classic kung-fu fighting techniques through the
        neoclassical style of Baat Ying Batt Faat (Eight Animals and Eight
        Methods). <br />
        By blending traditional kicking, striking, and grappling methods with
        modern fighting theories, our Si-Jo (founder) Allen Chinn <br />
        has created a system of Chinese Martial arts that respects tradition
        while staying relevant for today's practitioner.

      We use the sun-moon salute and standard stretches to open class. Our warm-up routine is a sequence of kicking, punching, and stance training. <br> The training portion varies according to the season, level of experience, and interests of the students. Training can include traditional forms, <br> weapons instruction, fighting drills, conditioning, or sparring*.
    </p>
    <p>Training sessions and classes usually consist of four parts.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> bowing in </li>
     <li> Stretching </li>
     <li> warm-up drills & Training</li>
     <li> bowing out. </li>

<p>
  *Sparring practice is not required and is reserved for intermediate and advanced students. <br>
Sparring requires a high level of trust and control - we treat it with the utmost respect and caution.
</p>
<p>We practice three types of sparring:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> traditional (unpadded no gear) controlled sparring</li>
 <li> competition style point sparring  </li>
 <li> contact sparring </li>
</ol>
