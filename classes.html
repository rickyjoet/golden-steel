            Classes are held at the International District Chinatown Community Center in Seattle, Washington. 
            We teach a variety of classic kung-fu fighting techniques through the neoclassical style of Baat Ying Batt Faat (Eight Animals and Eight Methods). By blending traditional kicking, striking, and grappling methods with modern fighting theories, our Si-Jo (founder) Allen Chinn
            has created a system of Chinese Martial arts that respects tradition while staying relevant for today's practitioner.
